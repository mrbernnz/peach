    - an add, substract, multiply, and divide button
    - an answer box, you choose the tag (e.g. label, read-only textbox)
  - when any of the buttons are clicked, use the two numbers the user entered into the textboxes to calculate the result and display the answer in the answer box
  - be sure to handle the case where the user tries to divide by zero

##Exercise: Cookbook part 1

Create a new html file that has a head and an empty body.

**In Javascript** do the following:
  - Add a heading that says "Lasagna!"
  - Under the heading, create an unordered list that has a "Pasta" item and a "Sauce" item.
  - **Hint**: use```createElement``` and ```appendChild```


##Exercise: Cookbook part 2

Using ```insertBefore```, put a paragraph tag with the text "Ingredients needed" between the heading and the unordered list.

##Exercise: Cookbook part 3

Using ```removeChild``` and ```insertBefore```, take out the "pasta" list item and replace it with "Lasagna Noodles".

Also, add a "Cheese" item to the list.


##Exercise: The Siiiiimpsons (part 1: Make the family)
Create an HTML page with an unordered list.

In a script tag, use JavaScript to **loop** through the following array and add each item to that list:  

```
["Homer", "Marge", "Bart", "Lisa", "Maggie", "Abe"]
```

##Exercise: The Siiiiimpsons (part 2: Add a Simpsons Character)
Add a button to your page (using HTML).
The rest of this exercise should be in a script tag.
When it is clicked, it will add a random Simpsons character from the following array:

```
["Apu", "Moe", "Barney", "Otto", "Nelson"]
```

**The Booooonus:** Make a copy of this file.  In the copy, modify the button to prompt the user for the name of a character and then add the result to the page.  You will not need to use the random array for this. This, too, should be done in a script tag.

## Exercise: Leaving The Siiiiimpsons list (I guess this is part 3, isn't it?)
Make another button to remove a character. This can be written in HTML if you'd like.

Clicking on this button will remove the last element in the list. This should be written in a script tag.

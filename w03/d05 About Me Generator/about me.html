<!-- Create an HTML file that only includes an html tag, a head that links to a stylesheet, a body tag, and a script tag.

Using javascript create:

one input takes the user's name
one input takes the user's sign
one input takes the user's hometown
one input takes the user's favorite css color
one submit button
When the user hits the submit button the inputs and button should disappear and an "about me" page should appear with the following minimum requirements:

The page should have a header with an h1 nested inside that says all about [USER NAME]
Under the header, create a div that spans across the entire page.
Within that div, make two more divs that are half the size of their parent div.
The div on the left should have a p tag stating the user's sign
the div on the right should have a p tag stating the user's hometown.
The body background color should be the user's favorite css color.
Hint: you can just set body.style.backgroundColor in javascript to change the background color.
Feel free to go cray cray with css. -->

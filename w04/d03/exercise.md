## Review
**Reference**

Don't forget to do this in a new folder
```js
npm init
npm install cowsay --save
```


#### Exercise: cowsay

**part 1**:
- write a client that upon receiving user input sends a cowsay'd version of the messsage to the server

**part 2**:
- write a server that upon receiving input from the client sends a cowsay'd version back to the client

## Websockets in the browser

An example of the difference between [client_node.js](client_node.js) and [client_browser.js](client_browser.js)

Note:
We don't yet know how to use npm libraries in browser-side javascript, but we will learn it later. You have to use a special tool called browserify to pull it off.

#### First Client in the browser
- Part 1:
  - `console.log` incoming messages
  - also `document.write` the messages
- Part 2:
  - create an `ul` element
  - add an `li` to this `ul` with the `innerHtml` set to the message
- Part 3: **Bonus**
  - change your solution to part 2 so that you add the li to the **top** of the list
  - **Hints**:
  - `element.firstChild`
    - called like `ul.firstChild`
    - [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.firstChild)
    - will return the first child of the ul element
  - `element.insertBefore`
    - called like `ul.insertBefore(newElement, elementToInsertBefore)`
    - [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.insertBefore)

```
var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000");

var addText = function(msg) {
  var newli = document.createElement("li");
  newli.innerHTML = msg;

  var ul = document.querySelector("ul");
  //https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.firstChild
  var firstli = ul.firstChild;
  ul.insertBefore(newli, firstli);
}

ws.addEventListener("open", function(evt) {
  addText('connected');
});

ws.addEventListener("message", function(evt) {
  addText(evt.data);
});
```


#### Exercise: Let the user chat!
*we need to add a way for the user of the browser chat to enter in text and send messages to the server*

- Add an input box on your page to capture input. Just put this in the html code, this does not need to be dynamically generated in javascript
- Add a button with an event listener that sends the text in the input box to the server
- Be sure to test this out using `wscat -l 3000` to act as a server

#### Further exercise: Styling
- add css to your `ul` element to have a styling property `list-style` of `none`
- while you're at it, add any other stylings and personality to your page.

#### Bonus: keydown on user input
- Ditch the button and instead allow the user to press the enter key while in the input box to send text to the server


## Keeping track of the clients connected to a server

#### Exercise : Put each `ws` in an array
- Hint: use ```.push()```

```
var WSS = require('ws').Server;
var server = new WSS({port: 3000});

var clients = [];

server.on("connection", function(ws) {
  clients.push(ws);
});
```

#### Exercise : Broadcasting messages
- everytime a client connects, broadcast  the message `client connected` to every already connected client

#### Exercise : handle the case when a client disconnects

Keeping track of client connections can be tricky because a client can disconnect while other clients are still connected.

Luckily, there the event `close` is called on a websocket object when it is disconnected.

```js
ws.on("close", function() {
  //do something
})
```

Use this event to handle the case when a client disconnects by removing that client's `ws` object from the array of clients.

#### Further Exercise : every second send all clients a "hello" message

#### Exercise : WebSocket Chatroom
There are only 3 requirements for a websocket server to be able to host a chatroom

1. Allow multiple clients to connect and keep track of them in an array
2. Be sure to handle the case where a client disconnects from the server
3. Here's the new part: When a user sends a message to the server have the server broadcast the message back to all the clients **except** the client that sent the message

That's it! Test it out by connecting to the server with multiple `wscat`'s (each in it's own terminal)

## Chatroom Enhancement ideas:

#### 1-line ASCII!!

- Whenever the user types in the message `(table flip)` (yes paranthesis are included)
  - send the message `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻` to the server.
  - in other words. Have the client recognize this text as a special command, and completely replace the message sent to the server. It's like an emoticon in Hipchat.
  - **Bonus**: implement other 1 line ascii art!!!
  - [1-line-ascii art link](http://1lineart.kulaone.com/)

#### Bonus: render img links in the browser chat client
- whenever the user (or somebody else you are chatting with) posts a link to an image, create an `<img>` tag and render it directly into the browser chat window (just like in hipchat)
- you can tell whether a link is an image because the very last characters of the url (link address) are `png` or `bmp` or `jpg` . E.g. http://animalia-life.com/data_images/wallpaper/cat-wallpaper/cat-wallpaper-01.jpg

#### Bonus: render gifs in the browser chat client
- same exercise as for img links but for rendering gifs
- gif links end with the characters `.gif` like http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Rotating_earth_%28large%29.gif

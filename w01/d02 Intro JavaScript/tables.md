## HTML Tables

Tables are used to display data on an HTML page, similar to spreadsheets used in Microsoft Excel or Google Docs. Similarly they use rows and columns to organize data in a way that is readable.
You can learn more about tables here: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp.

### Movie Site
You are going to create a page for your top 5 favorite movies using your new HTML skills!

You must include a header that includes your name (i.e. Sam's favorite movies).

You will also include a table with a row for each movie.  The column headers will be:

1. title
2. poster
3. IMDB
4. description
5. actors

The poster column can optionally be a picture from the movie.

The IMDB column is the link to the movie page on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com).

The actors can just be 3 actors' names seperated by commas (i.e. Will Ferell, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell).

Save this in a file called movies.html and push it to it's own Github repo.

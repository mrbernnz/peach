# Explore Github wikis

*Github wikis are an awesome way to jazz up any repository.*

**Reference:**
 - [Github's Wiki Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/)

**Examples:**
 - [Blacklight Wiki](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki)
 - [Impress.js Wiki](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/wiki)

**Requirements:**
  - Take the repository you made for last nights markdown homework involving 80s and 90s music hits
  - Create a wiki for that repository (some repositories don't have wikis, but they are usually on by default when you create a new repo)
  - Create a wiki page for each artist/band that was included in last night's homework
  - Be sure to include an image, gif, and link to their supposed website on this wiki page
  - Create a sidebar with a link to each artist/band (refer to the reference for how to add a sidebar)
  - Create a footer establishing this wiki page as the greatest of all time (or some other message of your choosing). Refer to the reference for how to add a footer.
  - Make sure that your main wiki page (the one that a user gets to right when they go into the wiki) is presentable and introduces the user to your taste in music (e.g. put whatever you want on there).

#### Draw a triangle
**You will need to know these methods (refer to the reference)**
  - beginPath
  - lineTo
  - fill

*Must be a solid triangle, as in not only are the lines of the triangle drawn, but the color of the triangle completely fills in the inside of that triangle.*

#### Draw a person!
*Draw as much of the face and body as you can.*
*This is a hard one so don't worry if you don't completely finish.*

**Here is how you draw a circle**

```
//ctx.arc(xposition, yposition, radius, 0, Math.PI*2, true);
//if you don't know what radius means, just know that a bigger
//radius will make a bigger circle, and 50 is a good starting point
ctx.arc(75,75,50,0,Math.PI*2,true);
```

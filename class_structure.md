# Princess Peach WDI

### Our goal
 That you graduate as a solid, entry-level programmer that can get a job in the web development industry.

You will be able to:
  - Program in Javascript and Ruby
  - Create a web application using various technologies
  - Pick up new libraries, frameworks, and even languages
  - Teach Yourself what you need to get the job done

# WDI Course Design

### Industry Driven and Instructor Driven

  - GA hires instructors from the industry to craft their curriculum and course structure
  - GA sometimes hires exceptional people from class to incorporate an insider's experience

### GA Ecosystem of Instructors and Classes

  - Each class is different, but we all share and collaborate on teaching strategies and tools
  - **Princess Zelda** will be running alongside our class
  - 5 total WDI classes in NYC. **Lemur** and **Galactica** currently in progress. One more will be starting December 1st.
  - Collaborate with a network of GA instructors across the world
    - "JS First" was drawn from WDI in Seattle, San Francisco, and LA

### WDI Adapts to You
- everybody learns at a different **pace**, this is a seperate concept from eventual mastery
- this class will meld to you so that you can keep going at the pace that is working for you
- individual weekly projects that
- lessons will be taught to smaller **groups** rather than the class as a whole
  - randomized groups in the beginning
  - we will rotate people between groups a lot in the beginning
  - eventual stabilization of groups based on the pace that is working for each individual.
- progression through material
  - all groups will be progressing through the same material during the first half.
  - material taught between groups will diverge towards the end of class
  - everybody will complete the core syllabus

### WDI Adapts as a whole

- agile philosophy: robust enough in order to change according to demand and feedback
- we **will** be modifying overall structure based on feedback/sucess

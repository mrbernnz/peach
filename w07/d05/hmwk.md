## MovieBrowser

For this homework it is not completely necessary to create a server. You will only be using the OMDB API and AJAX on the client-side.

#### Requirements

* Create a SPA (Single Page App) to browse your favorite movies.
* There can be as many as you want, let's say between 5 and 100.
* You can design your webapp however you wish, but here's an idea if you want to take it:
   * only show 1 movie at a time. Grab the information for that movie from OMDB. Display as much as you want on this page: A poster, the Year, Rating, IMDB rating, etc.
   * allow the user to slide/click to another movie, which makes a seperate call to OMDB to grab the information for that movie
* You could also design your site to show all the posters on one page, and then show more information when a user clicks on a poster. If you go down this route you would have to retreive all the posters right away, which might require multiple API requests initially.

#### You are encouraged to...
* Use CSS Animation!
* Use JQuery ... with parallax??
* Use LESS/SASS!
* Write it all in Python! (just kidding)

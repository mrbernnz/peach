## Teach a Topic!

### For this project you will be:
* Researching a topic of your choosing
* Creating a self guided tutorial
* Teaching the topic to the class


### Timing
* You will have all day today to work on this
* Lessons will start tomorrow morning right away

### Groups
* 3-5 people
* Form them yourself
* Everybody must contribute

### Repository Requirements
* Create a self-guided tutorial on your topic, completely written in markdown and on a Github Repo.
* Be sure to form a github organization for the repo.
* Any code files needed should be included in this repo.

### Lesson Requirements
* You will present on your topic tomorrow morning. Think of this as a real lesson that you are teaching to a class. How you conduct this lesson is up to you, and can take however long you feel is appropriate. Be mindful of people's attention span and interest. If it is over 45 minutes you might start to lose people's attention.
* The only requirement for the lesson is that there is at least one exercise that everyone in the class completes. You probably should go over the solution.

### Things that might help
* Pictures in your tutorial
* Keep your lesson engaging and exciting as much as possible
* Explain *why* somebody should be interested in your topic (jobs, common use cases, good times)

### Topics
* css animation
* jquery

* python
* php
* less and/or sass
* swift

#### Simple TODO app
- create an html page with one textbox and a button (which are in a form)
- when the button is clicked it sends a post to a sinatra/express server with the contents of the textbox
- the server processes the post request, rerenders the page in a template, and adds the contents of the textbox to a list of todo items below the textbox/button

# Excercise: HTTP server review

Write an http server that responds with "Hello World" to the user when you go to http://localhost:2000, and responds with "phooey" on anything else.

# Exercise: Echo server
Write an http server. When you go to http://localhost:2000/say/something, it will return everything after /say.  In this example, it will respond with "something"
If you don't have /say, respond with "Please go to http://localhost:2000/say/something"

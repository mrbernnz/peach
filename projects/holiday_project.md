# Holiday Portfolio Project
*Build a multi-page website that showcases some of the work that you have done in class*

#### Requirements

1. Multiple Pages
  - For instance:
    - Front page is a picture of you (or just a picture) with a snippet of text that explains that you are a full stack developer.
    - a page could be for projects that you have worked on
    - a page with links for Github/LinkedIn/Twitter/etc and any other contact info.
2. Pushed to Github
3. Hosted on Digital Ocean.
  - Served through an http server that you created in **node**, just like with the book app. In other words, don't just run `http-server`.
4. Showcase at least one project that you have worked on in class, and make sure that they are properly hosted and functional.
  - If you have canvas work that you wish to link to, you can just link to your Github Pages where they are hosted
  - We highly encourage you to also link to your chat app. This means that your chat app server code **must be running on your Digital Ocean box**. Just like when you originally hosted your chat app, you need to SSH into DO in one terminal and start your http server (which this time around you wrote the code for) and then in another terminal SSH back into DO and start your websocket server.


Other than that, this is a project to experiment with CSS and design. About me/Portfolio websites will help you in your job search once you graduate class. You will have more time to work on this, so just think of this as a start or a prototype of what you want it to eventually become.

## Outline

The period dedicated to projects in-class begins the afternoon of Thursday, February 12th. **On the afternoon of Thursday, February 19th, you will be privately showing your hosted project to an instructor. On Friday, February 20th we will be presenting our projects across the street in the morning and having our own private science fair in the afternoon**.

The dedicated project period is known as a ***sprint***. The purpose of the sprint is to fulfill a set of required features known as an ***MVP***, or *minimum viable product*.

**The end of the sprint is not the end of the project**.

**Each student/group will be responsible for their own project**. This means that every student must be able to explain what every piece of code does. Do not include code you do not understand!

Sam and ~~Diane~~ Crawford will meet with everyone in 1 on 1's this afternoon and tomorrow morning to discuss your project ideas. Sign up for a time slot [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VE0sFql2z2GWTtNrN-vW8LwLmUJDo-JcDN80PPDsuoo/edit?usp=sharing).

We will also be available for help on Tuesday and Wednesday. For us to help you with the challenges you come across you must have a list of three resources that you consulted before reaching out to us.

On Wednesday, 2/18, we will make availabe a sign up sheet for Thursday's mandatory 1 on 1's.

## Objectives

- Pull together all the knowledge and experience of the last 3 months by building a web application from the ground up.
- Practice integrating topics covered during this course thus far, bridging the gaps between the various areas of a web app (client-side and server-side).
- Effectively use [GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles).

## Core Requirements

__Application__
- A web framework such as Sinatra, Express, or Rails.
- Persistance using SQLite3.
  * If you want to use another SQL DB such as PostgreSQL just keep in mind that it will effect your deployment solution. ([DO/PostgreSQL/Rails guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-ruby-on-rails-with-postgres))
- Your frontend can optionally use Backbone.
- You can design your app as a SPA, MPA, or anything inbetween.
- A user authentication scheme must be used.
  * Users should be able to log in and out.
- An external API must be consumed.
- Resources to research API's:
  * [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/)
  * [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/)
- All of your routes should follow REST protocol.

__Deployment__
- Your application **MUST** be hosted, we suggest using Heroku or Digital Ocean.
- When presentation time comes around, you will be demo'ing the hosted version.

__Bonus__
- Buy a domain name and have it hooked up to your Heroku or Digital Ocean deployment.


## Deliverables (Due on Thursday, February 19th)

- The MVP of an application with a detailed README that features:
- A short description of your Application
- Team members
- Technologies used
- Wireframes
- ERDs
- A Github repo that holds your project.
- Lightning talk that:
 - Demos your application on Heroku or Digital Ocean; you will be presenting this talk in a 1 on 1 with an instructor.


##Order of Operations

**This is not a hack fest!** Cobbling or hacking together a bunch of code is not the point of this project. We want to write well structured, easy to read, and working code.

To this end, make sure you spend enough time planning your application and how you are going to implement it.

Before writing any code at all you should have the following done:
- Create user stories.
- Create an ERD.
- Select and experiment with your external API to ensure you can access the data you plan on using.
- Building an MPA? Know what pages you will need to build and what features will be on each page
- Building an SPA? Know what templates you will need to build and what features will be in each template.
- Create a github repository.
- If you are working with a partner create a working schedule and assign duties.

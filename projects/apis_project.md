# Weekly Project: APIs

Choose from one of the following choices:

1. Create a D3 visualization of data coming back from an API of your choice
  * You could also use another library for visualizing data, such as:
    * [Springy](https://github.com/dhotson/springy) [[demo](http://getspringy.com/demo.html)]
    * Three.js
    * [Dimple](http://dimplejs.org/examples_index.html)
    * [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/)
2. Add a JSON API to your chat app
  * Possible routes:
    * `/nicks`
    * `/history`
    * `/nick/history`
    * `/nick/kick`
    * `/say`
3. Free Form
    * If there is anything you want to try out this weekend related to APIs, especially if it might lead to a larger final project, go for it.
4. Do review instead
  * more review questions will be given out on Friday.

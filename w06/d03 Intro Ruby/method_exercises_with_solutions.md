#### Exercise: Weatherman
Write a method that takes a weather condition and a temperature. Weather can be "rainy", "sunny", "windy". Temperature can be "hot" or "cold".

- If the condition is rainy and the temperature is cold, tell the user, "better stay inside!"
- If the condition is rainy and the temperature is hot, tell the user, "sounds like a gross combination"
- If the condition is sunny and the temperature is hot, tell the user, "maybe best to go swimming"
- If the condition is windy or the temperature is cold tell the user, "bundle up!"
- If the condition is windy and the temperature is hot, tell the user "Tornado warning!"

##### Ruby
```rb
def weather(condition, temperature)
  if condition == "rainy"
    puts "Better stay inside!"
  end

  if condition == "rainy" && temperature == "hot"
    puts "Sounds like a gross combination"
  end

  if condition == "sunny" && temperature == "hot"
    puts "Maybe best go swimming"
  end

  if condition == "windy" && temperature == "cold"
    puts "Bundle up!"
  end

  if condition == "windy" && temperature == "hot"
    puts "Tornado warning!"
  end
end

weather("rainy", "hot")
weather("windy", "cold")
weather("sunny", "hot")
```
##### JavaScript
```js
var weather = function(condition, temperature) {
  if(condition === "rainy") {
    console.log("Better stay inside!");
  }

  if(condition === "rainy" && temperature === "hot") {
    console.log("Sounds like a gross combination");
  }

  if(condition === "sunny" && temperature === "hot") {
    console.log("Maybe best go swimming");
  }

  if(condition === "windy" && temperature === "cold") {
    console.log("Bundle up!");
  }

  if(condition === "windy" && temperature === "hot") {
    console.log("Tornado warning!");
  }
};

weather("rainy", "hot")
weather("windy", "cold")
weather("sunny", "hot")
```

#### Exercise: The meaning of Life
Write a method called `meaning_of_life` which returns the number 42 to you.  
Use this method to write a Ruby program that:
- Asks the user whether they want to know what the meaning of life is
- If the user enters 'y', then the meaning of life is displayed to them using the `meaning_of_life` method
- Otherwise, the program displays a disappointed message to the user and quits

##### Ruby
```rb
def meaning_of_life
  return 42
end

puts "Do you want to know the meaning of life?"
user_wants_to_know = gets.chomp

if(user_wants_to_know == "y")
  puts meaning_of_life
else
  puts "Oh, how disappointing!"
end
```

###### JavaScript
```js
var meaning_of_life = function() {
  return 42;
};

console.log("Do you want to know the meaning of life?");
process.stdin.on("data", function(data) {
  if(data.toString().trim() === "y") {
    console.log(meaning_of_life());
    process.stdin.end()
  }
  else {
    console.log("Oh, how disappointing!");
    process.stdin.end()
  }
  });

```
#### Exercise: Fives  
  Write a method called `mult_five?` which accepts one number argument.
  Returns true if the argument is divisible by five, otherwise return false.  

  Use this method within a while loop. Within the while loop, ask the user to enter a number or enter the word "quit".  If the user enters a number, use mult_five? to check the number and let the user know if their number was divisible by five
  If the user entered quit, exit the program.  

##### Ruby

```ruby
  def mult_five(number)
    return number % 5 == 0
  end

  get_fives = true

  while get_fives
    puts "Enter a number or quit:"
    number = gets.chomp
    if number == "quit"
      puts "Goodbye"
      get_fives = false
    else
      multiple_of_five = mult_five(number.to_i)
      if multiple_of_five
        puts number + " is a multiple of 5"
      else
        puts number + " is not a multiple of 5"
      end
    end
    puts
  end
```

##### JavaScript
  ```js
  var mult_five = function(number) {
    return number % 5 === 0;
  };

  console.log("Enter a number or quit:");
  process.stdin.on('data', function(data) {
    var input = data.toString().trim();
    if(input === "quit") {
      console.log("Goodbye");
      process.stdin.end();
    }
    else {
      var number = parseInt(input);
      var multiple_of_five = mult_five(number);
      if(multiple_of_five) {
        console.log(number + " is a multiple of 5");
      }
      else {
        console.log(number + " is not a multiple of 5");
      }
      console.log();
      console.log("Enter a number or quit:");
    }
    });
```

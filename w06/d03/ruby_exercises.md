# Once more, with RUBY!
## EIEInope
For this exercise, consider "Y" to be a consonant.

Write a command line application that prompts the user for a word. If the word has more than one vowel puts "It checks out."

###Bonus:
If the word has more than one vowel AND no vowels are adjacent puts "It checks out", otherwise puts "nope".

For example, "Eat" returns "nope", "Ate" returns "It checks out"

###Bonus 2:
instead of putsing "It checks out", puts the consonants in the word.

## Stuck in the middle with gets
Write a command line application that prompts the user for two integers. The application should generate a random number; if the random number is lower than both numbers puts "too cold", if the random number is higher than both numbers puts "too hot", and if the random number is between the two numbers puts "Just right!"

###Bonus:
Also puts all three numbers in numerical order.

## Even on a jet plane
Write a command line application that takes a string from the user. Split the string on spaces and set that output to a new array. loop through the array, putsing any element of the array with an even amount of letters.

###Bonus:
puts only the arguments that have an even amount of letters and an index that is divisible evenly by 3.

## We want the meth
Write a command line application that prompts the user for an integer and a word. The application should have a method that takes the user's input as parameters. If the number is even, the method should puts the string. If the number is odd, the method should puts the string in reverse.

## EIEInope
For this exercise, consider "Y" to be a consonant.

Write a command line application that takes one word as an argument. If the word has more than one vowel log "It checks out."

###Bonus:
If the word has more than one vowel AND no vowels are adjacent log "It checks out", otherwise log "nope".

For example, "Eat" returns "nope", "Ate" returns "It checks out"

###Bonus 2:
instead of logging "It checks out", log the consonants in the word.

## Stuck in the middle with args
Write a command line application that takes two integers as arguments. The application should generate a random number; if the random number is lower than both arguments log "too cold", if the random number is higher than both arguments log "too hot", and if the random number is between the two arguments log "Just right!"

###Bonus:
Also log all three numbers in numerical order.

## Even on a jet plane
Write a command line application that takes any number of string arguments. Create an array of the arguments. Log only the arguments that have an even amount of letters.

###Bonus:
Log only the arguments that have an even amount of letters and an index that is divisible evenly by 3.

## We want the func
Write a command line application that takes one string and one integer as arguments. The application should have a function that takes the arguments as parameters. If the number is even, the function should log the string. If the number is odd, the function should log the string in reverse.

## Give up the func
Write a command line application that includes a function that logs "BASS IN YER FACE". The function should be called every 3 seconds. Have it stop after the fourth time.

## The foreman swears he learned his math
Write a command line application that has an object constructor that creates a Dozer object that has a color parameter, a name parameter, and a backup method that logs "BEEP BEEP BEEP" when called. Make a new instance of the Dozer object and logs its name and color, then call the backup method on the new object.

## It's a final countdown
Write a basic HTML page that prompts the user for a number. Using javascript, create a paragraph tag with that number. Have the number decrease by one each second until it reaches zero, at which point the background should turn red and the zero should turn white.

# Princess Peach Domains

Your `[name].princesspeach.nyc` domains now point to the DO box that you created with your own DO account. Your new ip addresses are listed below.

**Important:**

Your old servers (what `[name].princesspeach.nyc` used to point to) will continue to exist **until Monday 2/16 NOON** at which point they will be terminated. You can access them through ssh or through the browser by using their ip address **which are listed in a second table below**.


## Want to set up your own domain?
Awesome you should! Our `princesspeach.nyc` domain name was about `$30` and wasn't too hard to set up.

Here is the guide we used to set up the domains on Digital Ocean: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean

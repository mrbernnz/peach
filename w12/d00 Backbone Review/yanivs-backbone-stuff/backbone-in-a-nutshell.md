# Backbone in a Nutshell

* Organization of code
  - Makes up for having a ton of spaghetti code
* Organizing through:
  - Collections
  - Models
  - Views

  ## Models

  * Deals with the data
    - storing
    - interact with data
      * (eg, a 'fullname' function)


  ## Collections

  * A collection of models of one type
  * Handle AJAX reqeusts to the server
    - RESTful pattern

  ## Views

  * Showing data on the DOM
    - Traditionally using a single model
  * Respond to DOM events

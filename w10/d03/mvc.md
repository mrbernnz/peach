#ALL ABOUT MVC

[read this](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvc)

Pay close attention to the sections "Model", "View", and "Controller" - this is the meat and potatoes of this section of text and, even though it is referencing javascript, is the basis for rails' organization.

There's a lot of excess information about templating and a few other frameworks, at least skim through that.

Read up to and including "What does MVC give us?".

Then, look at this. It's beautiful.

Tomorrow we will be doing our first rails app; these concepts will become more clear as you get exposed to them. Happy reading!
